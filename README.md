Phenix is a web framework built on pure PHP, without external extensions, based on the [Amphp](https://amphp.org/)  ecosystem, which provides non-blocking operations, asynchronism and parallel code execution natively. It runs in the PHP SAPI CLI and on its own server, it is simply powerful.

> **Note:** This repository contains the core code of the Phenix framework. If you want to build a web application using Phenix, visit the [application skeleton](https://github.com/phenixphp/phenix) repository.
